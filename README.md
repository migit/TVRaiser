# TVRaiser

TVRaiser is an idea sparked in mind when We observed useless TV screens in the store and raising them up from the dead to show some cool stuffs of other smart devices in the house. Eg coffee machine brewing status, what is in the fridge...stuff like that. the basic idea is to to ask for status reports of other devices and also it is designed to show also internal meeting, announcement and other relevant internal project status and messages in the office in the local network throw the TVRaiser app.
